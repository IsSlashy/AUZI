# AuziFront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.1.

## Project Overview

**Auzi** is a web platform designed to assist French expatriates in Australia in easily finding temp job agencies. We streamline the process by comparing French CVs with Australian standards and providing a selection of the best profiles to temp agencies. This simplifies the job search for expatriates while ensuring agencies receive top-tier candidates.  
Additionally, we offer a service to help with completing the necessary paperwork for the Working Holiday Visa (PVT) by working directly with Australian tourism authorities.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
